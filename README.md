# disformer
The general idea is a dynamically generated platformer with "sets" of 10 levels that ramp up in difficulty (with 10 distinct difficulty classes based on user win rates, as in a 90% or higher user win rate is easy, between 80% and 90% is slightly harder, and etc.).  It will be a very basic platformer with collisions between a square that can jump and the generated tiles.
